## Usage

The Sudoku solver program is a Python script that contains the main logic for solving Sudoku puzzles. The `solve_sudoku` function takes a 9x9 Sudoku board as input, represented as a list of lists, with `0` indicating empty cells. The function modifies the input board in place and returns `True` if a solution is found, otherwise `False`.

The `is_safe` function is a helper function that checks if it is safe to assign a number to a given cell in the Sudoku board.

The `find_empty_cell` function is another helper function that searches for an empty cell in the board.

To use the solver, import the `solve_sudoku` function into your own code and pass your Sudoku board as a list of lists to get the solved result.

## Example

```python
from sudoku_solver import solve_sudoku

# Example Sudoku board (0 represents an empty cell)
example_board = [ [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
 [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3],
 [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],
 [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],
 [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9]
]

if solve_sudoku(example_board):
 for row in example_board:
     print(row)
else:
 print("No solution exists for the given Sudoku puzzle.")
